    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nothing makes you feel like a professional chef quite like nailing the perfect fried egg in your very own kitchen. No matter if it’s topping a toasty buttered bagel or sliding onto a crispy potato hash, a smooth, golden yolk isn’t just delicious, it’s also the epitome of aesthetic cooking. </p>
    <p> However, sometimes the runny, fried egg moment you picture in your head never actually makes it to the plate. Between the transfer and the handling, that fragile yolk can burst and start cooking right in your hot pan—and that, my friends, can put a major damper on your morning toast. </p>
    <P> So, we wanted to share a trick that will help you avoid any broken yolks for all breakfasts from here on out. It doesn’t require any new kitchen skills, and it makes use of something you definitely already have in your kitchen. </P>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Ice cube</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the ice in an open area of the pan away from the eggs (so they don’t get water-logged), turn the heat down to low, and cover the pan. Then, watch as the eggs turn from raw ingredients to soft, perfectly-set creations. </li>
    </ol>
